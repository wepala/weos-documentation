WeOS takes a design first approach with the [OpenAPI specifications](https://openapis.org) at its core. For simple APIs that are basic create, read, update, delete functionality
(CRUD), you can create a vanilla OpenAPI specification using [OpenAPI schemas](https://swagger.io/docs/specification/data-models/) to model your data. We also provide extensions
for adding controllers and middleware to endpoints. See our [User guide][user-guide] to understand the functionality available. You can also use one of our [examples](/docs/examples) as a starting point.

Once you have your api setup there are a couple of ways to get started with WeOS.
1. [Use the command line application][weos-cli]
2. [Build a custom binary][customization]
