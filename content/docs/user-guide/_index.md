WeOS takes a design-first approach using [OpenAPI specifications][openapi]. WeOS uses the OpenAPI specification to set up routes
and automatically associate controllers. WeOS attempts to allow developers to get a lot done with "vanilla" OpenAPI,
although you can use [OpenAPI extensions][extensions] to provide additional customizations and configurations.
